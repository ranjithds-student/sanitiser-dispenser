Arduino Sanitizer Dispenser
This repository contains Arduino code for a sanitizer dispenser project utilizing an Arduino Uno microcontroller, an SG90 servo motor, and an ultrasonic sensor.

Project Overview
In response to the ongoing need for hygiene and sanitation measures, this project aims to provide an automated solution for dispensing sanitizer. The Arduino-based dispenser offers a touchless operation, triggered by the proximity of a user's hand detected by the ultrasonic sensor.

Components Used
Arduino Uno: The heart of the project, responsible for controlling the dispenser's operation.
SG90 Servo Motor: Utilized for dispensing the sanitizer, providing precise control over the dispensing mechanism.
Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects the presence of a user's hand, initiating the sanitizer dispensing process.
Features
Touchless Operation: The dispenser operates without the need for physical contact, promoting hygiene and minimizing the spread of germs.
Customizable Dispensing Mechanism: The servo motor allows for adjustable dispensing angles and volumes, catering to various container sizes and sanitizer viscosities.
Real-time Feedback: LED indicators or buzzer feedback can be incorporated to signal successful dispensing or system status.
Usage
Hardware Setup: Connect the Arduino Uno to the servo motor and ultrasonic sensor according to the provided schematic.
Upload Code: Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE or compatible software.
Power On: Power up the Arduino Uno and ensure all components are functioning correctly.
Operate: Place your hand within the range of the ultrasonic sensor to trigger sanitizer dispensing.
